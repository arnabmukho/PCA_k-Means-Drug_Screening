# PCA_k-Means-Drug_Screening
Virtual screening has emerged as a potent technique for detecting novel compounds from extensive chemical libraries, utilizing knowledge about the target protein or established active ligands. Employing machine learning in virtual screening has a pivotal role in modern drug discovery, as it mitigates the burden of time and expenses. Dealing with vast datasets poses a laborious challenge, hence principal component analysis (PCA) is commonly employed to streamline the complex chemical space. This simplification allows researchers to concentrate on pivotal attributes for evaluating potential lead molecules. Through unsupervised learning, data patterns are discerned, establishing connections between known active compounds and unfamiliar ones based on their overarching structural and physicochemical attributes. Consequently, these compounds are grouped into clusters according to their similarities.
